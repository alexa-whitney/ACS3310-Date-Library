Hello, time-traveler! Welcome to **TickTalk.js**, where we're always up for a *date night* with your code. Want to manage your dates without the dread? Let's **talk ticks!** 🗓️

## Description 📖

**TickTalk.js** isn't just another date library – it's your trusty sidekick in the ever-ticking world of JavaScript dates. Consider it a rendezvous between clarity and functionality, making your date operations more intuitive and less... *date-ing* (pun absolutely intended).

## Why TickTalk.js? 🤔

Every developer knows the classic JS Date Object is like a flaky date – unpredictable and often disappointing. That's why we've wrapped it up and presented it in a way that's more approachable and, dare we say, fun!

## Setting Up the Date 🌹

### Project Structure:

1. 📁 **src** - All your source code sits here, waiting for the next date!
2. 📁 **tests** - This is where we ensure our dates go smoothly.

### Initialization:

- Set up a new rendezvous: `npm init -y`
- Invite Jest over for some testing fun: `npm install --save-dev jest`

Don't forget the `.gitignore` – because some things, like `node_modules`, are better left unsaid.

## Features & Usage 🌟

Our library lets you dance around date problems:

- **Easy Instantiation** - Initialize just like you would with the classic Date object.
  
    ```javascript
    const d = new D('9/26/1965');  // Let's have a retro date night!
    ```

- **Human Readable Values** - Dates are more than numbers, they have names!

    ```javascript
    console.log(d.year);   // Get the full year
    console.log(d.mon);    // Just the short month
    console.log(d.dy);     // And a snazzy day!
    ```

- **Flexible Formatting** - Want your date to wear a different outfit? You got it.

    ```javascript
    console.log(d.format('y/m/d h:i:s'));
    ```

- **Relative Dating with `when()`** - Know if you're reminiscing about the past or dreaming about the future.

    ```javascript
    console.log(d.when()); // Was it 6 months ago or 3 months from now?
    ```

- **Documented Affair** - JS Doc string comments ensure that this isn't a mysterious date.

... and so much more!
